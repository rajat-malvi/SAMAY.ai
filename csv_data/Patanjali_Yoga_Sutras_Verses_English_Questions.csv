Patanjali Yoga Sutras,1,21,तीव्रसंवेगानामासन्नः,"Those who earnestly seek liberation will find that realization is within reach, depending on the intensity of their practice.",Does intense practice help in achieving realisation?,"Committed is a translation of samvega. Hariharananda gives this explanation: “The word ‘Samvega’ is a technical term in the science of Yoga. We find it in Buddhist literature also.

Two distinctions are mentioned in this Sutra. The first is not being affecting by the five kleshas which are ignorance, identification with I-am-ness, attraction, aversion, and clinging to life.

What constitutes Kriya Yoga? Is devotion to God a part of Yoga? Is devotion to God a part of Kriya Yoga?,"In modern Hindu teachings, the most common use of the term kriya yoga is to refer to a breathing technique, pranayama. Here, however, the term kriya yoga simply means the “yoga of action.” Kriya can have the sense of religious action and therefore kriya yoga could also be rendered in English as “the yoga of religious action.” The concept of austerity, tapas, may bring to mind images of yogis in the Himalayas living in a cave or bathing in the winter in the freezing waters of the Ganges. Though tapas does include these intense practices, it also includes easier ones that can be done by all. A simple form of tapas is sacrifice. Sacrifice is the act of giving up to a greater power a cherished possession be it money, time, intelligence or a physical object to manifest a greater good. The commentators describe self-study, svadhyaya, as recitation (japa) of the sacred syllable AUM and other similar mantras and as the study of the sacred lore on liberation. (moksha shastra). Though yoga as taught today tends to altogether leave out the concept of the Personal God, Ishvara, the Yoga Sutras give worship of and cultivating devotion to Ishvara a place of importance.",tapaḥsvādhyāyeśvarapraṇidhānāni kriyāyogaḥ,Sādhana-pāda
